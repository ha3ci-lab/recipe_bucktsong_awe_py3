Feature Extraction
==================

Overview
--------
To extract MFCC and filterbank features, run:

    ./extract_features_buckeye.py
    ./extract_features_xitsonga.py

The rest of this document describes some of the feature sets and file formats.


Buckeye sets
------------
Buckeye is divided into a number of sets based on the speakers:

- sample: s2801a, s2801b, s2802a, s2802b, s2803a, s3701a, s3701b, s3702a,
  s3702b, s3703a, s3703b
- devpart1 (used for training): s02, s04, s05, s08, s12, s16, s03, s06, s10,
  s11, s13, s38
- devpart2 (used for validation): s18, s17, s37, s39, s19, s22, s40, s34
- ZS (used for testing): s20, s25, s27, s01, s26, s31, s29, s23, s24, s32, s33,
  s30


Word lists
----------
Sets of isolated words are extracted, based on different constraints. Files
might be tagged as follows:

- samediff: contains ground truth word tokens of at least 50 frames and 5
  characters.
- samediff2: contains ground truth word tokens of at least 39 frames and 4
  characters. On devpart1, this results in a similar number of tokens as for
  the UTD set (below).
- utd: terms discovered with an unsupervised term discovery (UTD) system.


NumPy archive key format
------------------------
For the unsegmented feature NumPy archives (e.g. `mfcc/buckeye/zs.dd.npz`),
dictionary keys look as follows:

    s01_01a_003222-003255

For speaker `s01`, this is utterance `01a` from frames `3222` to `3255`.

For the archives containing isolated words (e.g.
`mfcc/buckeye/zs.samediff.dd.npz`), the keys look as follows:

    abandoned_s06_02a_044207-044257

This indicates that the segment contains features for the word `abandoned`
spoken by speaker `s06` in utterance `02a`, with the word occurring from frame
`44207` to `44257`. For archives with discovered words (e.g.
`mfcc/buckeye/devpart1.utd.dd.npz`), the keys  look as follows:

    PT10000_s21_02b_027358-027413

where `PT10000` refers to the the cluster (or pseudo term) to which this
segment is assigned.
